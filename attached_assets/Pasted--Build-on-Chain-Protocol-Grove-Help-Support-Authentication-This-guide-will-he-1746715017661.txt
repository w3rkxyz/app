Authentication
This guide will help you understand how to handle authentication in Lens.

The Lens API uses authentication roles to define different levels of access and interaction:

Account Owner: An end-user who owns a Lens Account.

Account Manager: An end-user managing a Lens Account, either their own or one they have been delegated. See the Account Managers guide for more information.

Onboarding User: A end-user without a Lens Account, limited to features related to onboarding, such as creating an account.

Builder: A developer role used to authenticate and access configuration and management features.

Log In to Lens
End-user roles such as Account Owner, Account Manager, or Onboarding User require the EVM address of the App they want to connect to in order to log in to Lens. In contrast, the Builder role does not require an App address for authentication.

For quick experimentation with Lens, a test App has been deployed on each network:

Lens Mainnet: 
0x8A5Cc31180c37078e1EbA2A23c861Acf351a97cE

Lens Testnet: 
0xC75A89145d765c396fd75CbD16380Eb184Bd2ca7

You can learn how to create your own App in the Apps guide .

TypeScript
GraphQL
React
We'll use viem's Local Account in our example, but you can use a 
WalletClient
 instance from the wagmi hook or an ethers.js Signer.

Chose the adapter for the library of your choice:

viem
ethers
import { signMessageWith } from "@lens-protocol/client/viem";
And, use the 
PublicClient
 instance you created earlier to log in and acquire a 
SessionClient
 instance.

Onboarding User
Account Owner
Account Manager
Builder
client.ts
signer.ts
import { client } from "./client";
import { signer } from "./signer";

const authenticated = await client.login({
  onboardingUser: {
    app: "0x5678…",
    wallet: signer.address,
  },
  signMessage: signMessageWith(signer),
});

if (authenticated.isErr()) {
  return console.error(authenticated.error);
}

// SessionClient: { ... }
const sessionClient = authenticated.value;
Use the 
SessionClient
 to interact with 
@lens-protocol/client/actions
 that require authentication.

The 
@lens-protocol/client/actions
 that require authentication are explicitly labelled by the type of client they accept as first argument.

List Available Accounts
Often, when you are about to log in with an Account, you may want to list the available Accounts for the user's wallet.

TypeScript
GraphQL
React
Use the paginated 
fetchAccountsAvailable
 action to list the Accounts available for the given wallet address.

Example
client.ts
import { evmAddress } from "@lens-protocol/client";
import { fetchAccountsAvailable } from "@lens-protocol/client/actions";

import { client } from "./client";

const result = await fetchAccountsAvailable(client, {
  managedBy: evmAddress("0x1234…"),
  includeOwned: true,
});
Continue with the Pagination guide for more information on how to handle paginated results.

See the Account Manager guide for more information on how to manage accounts.

Manage Sessions
Once you have successfully authenticated, you can manage your authenticated sessions by:

Keeping your session alive

Getting details about the current session

Listing all authenticated sessions

Keep Alive
TypeScript
GraphQL
React
Resume Session
By default, the 
PublicClient
 uses in-memory storage for the storing the authenticated session, which is lost when the current thread closes, like when refreshing a page in a browser. To keep the session persistent, supply a long-term storage solution to the 
PublicClient
 config.

In a browser, for instance, you could use the Web Storage API like 
window.localStorage
:

client.ts
import { PublicClient, mainnet } from "@lens-protocol/client";

const const client = PublicClient.create({
  environment: mainnet

  storage: window.localStorage,
});
Then resume an authenticated 
SessionClient
 from long-term storage like so:

Resume Session
import { client } from "./client";

const resumed = await client.resumeSession();

if (resumed.isErr()) {
  return console.error(resumed.error);
}

// SessionClient: { ... }
const sessionClient = resumed.value;
The 
SessionClient
 instance is now ready to be used for authenticated requests.

Get Current Session
TypeScript
GraphQL
React
Use the 
currentSession
 action:

import { currentSession } from "@lens-protocol/client/actions";
to get details about the current session.

const result = await currentSession(sessionClient);

if (result.isErr()) {
  return console.error(result.error);
}

// AuthenticatedSession: { authenticationId: UUID, app: EvmAddress, ... }
const session = result.value;
List Authenticated Sessions
TypeScript
GraphQL
React
Use the 
fetchAuthenticatedSessions
 action:

import { fetchAuthenticatedSessions } from "@lens-protocol/client/actions";
to get a paginated list of all authenticated sessions.

All Sessions
By App
const result = await fetchAuthenticatedSessions(sessionClient);

if (result.isErr()) {
  return console.error(result.error);
}

// Array<AuthenticatedSession>: [{ authenticationId: UUID, app: EvmAddress, ... }, ... ]
const sessions = result.value.items;
See the Pagination guide for more information on how to handle paginated results.

Log Out
You MUST be authenticated as Account Owner or Account Manager to make this request.

TypeScript
GraphQL
React
Use the 
client.logout
 method to revoke any authenticated session and clear any client state.

const result = await client.logout();
Get Last Logged-In Account
A simple way to fetch a user's last Lens account login, helping returning users quickly identify and access their previous account before authentication is required.

TypeScript
GraphQL
React
Use the 
lastLoggedInAccount
 action to get the last logged-in account.

All Apps
Specific App
import { evmAddress } from "@lens-protocol/client";
import { lastLoggedInAccount } from "@lens-protocol/client/actions";

const result = await lastLoggedInAccount(anyClient, {
  address: evmAddress("0x1234…"),
});

if (result.isErr()) {
  return console.error(result.error);
}
Advanced Topics
Authentication Storage
If you need to store authentication tokens in a custom storage solution with the Lens SDK, implement the 
IStorageProvider
 interface.

IStorageProvider
interface IStorageProvider {
  getItem(key: string): Promise<string | null> | string | null;

  setItem(
    key: string,
    value: string
  ): Promise<string> | Promise<void> | void | string;

  removeItem(key: string): Promise<string> | Promise<void> | void;
}
For example, you can use the 
cookie-next
 library for Next.js to store and pass the authentication tokens between client and server of a Next.js application.

storage.ts
client.ts
import { getCookie, setCookie, deleteCookie } from "cookies-next";
import { IStorageProvider } from "@lens-protocol/client";

export const storage: IStorageProvider = {
  getItem(key: string) {
    return getCookie(key) ?? null;
  },

  setItem(key: string, value: string) {
    await setCookie(key, value);
  },

  removeItem(key: string) {
    await deleteCookie(key);
  },
};
Authentication Tokens
Lens API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as format for Token-Based authentication.

On successful authentication, Lens API issues three tokens:

Access Token

ID Token

Refresh Token

Lens JWTs are signed with the RS256 algorithm and can be verified using JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) from the 
/.well-known/jwks.json
 endpoint on the corresponding Lens API environment:

Mainnet: 
https://api.lens.xyz/.well-known/jwks.json

Testnet: 
https://api.testnet.lens.xyz/.well-known/jwks.json

Signing keys could be rotated at any time. Make sure to cache the JWKS and update it periodically.

Access Token
Access Tokens are used to authenticate a user's identity when making requests to the Lens API.

The Access Token is required in the 
Authorization
 or 
x-access-token
 header for all authenticated requests to the Lens API.

Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
# or
x-access-token: <access-token>
DO NOT share the Access Token with anyone. Keep it secure and confidential. If you are looking to identify a user's request on a backend service, use the ID Token instead.

Lens Access Tokens are valid for 10 minutes from the time of issuance.

Refresh Token
A Refresh Token is a credential artifact used to obtain a new authentication tokens triplet without user interaction. This allows for a shorter Access Token lifetime for security purposes without involving the user when the access token expires. You can request new authentication tokens until the refresh token is added to a denylist or expires.

DO NOT share the Refresh Token with anyone. Keep it secure and confidential, possibly on the client-side only. If you are looking to perform an operation in behalf of an Account, use the Account Manager feature instead.

Lens Refresh Tokens are valid for 7 days from the time of issuance.

ID Token
The ID Token is used to verify the user's identity on consumer's side. It contains a set of claims about the user and is signed by the Lens API.

Lens ID Tokens are valid for 10 minutes from the time of issuance, same as the Access Token.

You can use the ID Token to verify the user's identity on a backend service like described in the Consume Lens ID Tokens section.

Consume Lens ID Tokens
As briefly mentioned earlier, Lens ID Tokens can be used to verify's user identity on a backend service.

Lens ID Tokens are issued with the following claims:

Claim
Description
sub
Subject - the 
signedBy
 address used to sign the Authentication Challenge. This could be the Account or an Account Manager for it. Example: 
0xC47Cccc2bf4CF2635a817C01c6A6d965045b06e6
.	
iss
Issuer - the Lens API endpoint that issued the token. Typically: 
https://api.lens.xyz
.	
aud
Audience - the Lens App address that the token is intended for. Example: 
0x00004747f7a56EE7Af7237220c960a7D06232626
.	
iat
Issued At - the timestamp when the token was issued.
exp
Expiration - the timestamp indicating when the token will expire. This can be used to determine if the token is still valid.
sid
Session ID - the unique identifier of the session that the token was issued for.
act
Optional claim that allows the token to act on behalf of another Account. This is useful for Account Managers to specify the Account address they can act on behalf of.
tag:lens.dev,2024:sponsored
Custom claim that indicates the authenticated session is enabled for sponsored transactions.
tag:lens.dev,2024:role
Custom claim that indicates the role of the authenticated session. Possible values are 
ACCOUNT_OWNER
, 
ACCOUNT_MANAGER
, 
ONBOARDING_USER
, and 
BUILDER
.	
A typical use case is to use Lens issued ID Token to verify the legitimacy of user's request before issuing your app specific credentials. The following diagram illustrates this flow:

Your Backend Service
Lens API

Later on…
Verify Lens ID Token

Fetch /.well-known/jwks.json

Issues ID Token
Authenticate w/ Lens ID Token
Issues app credentials
Below is an example of a Next.js middleware that demonstrates how to verify a Lens ID Token using the popular jose library:

middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { jwtVerify, createRemoteJWKSet } from "jose";

// Get JWKS URI from environment variables
const jwksUri = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_JWKS_URI;
const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL(jwksUri));

export async function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.headers.get("authorization")?.split(" ")[1];

  if (!token) {
    return new NextResponse(
      JSON.stringify({ error: "Authorization token missing" }),
      {
        status: 401,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      }
    );
  }

  try {
    // Verify the JWT using the JWKS
    const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS);

    // Optionally, attach the payload to the request
    req.user = payload;

    // Proceed to the API route
    return NextResponse.next();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("JWT verification failed:", error);
    return new NextResponse(
      JSON.stringify({ error: "Invalid or expired token" }),
      {
        status: 401,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      }
    );
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/api/:path*"],
};
The example works under the following assumptions:

The Lens ID Token is passed in the 
Authorization
 header as a Bearer token (e.g., 
Authorization: Bearer <ID Token>
).

The JWKS URI is available in the 
NEXT_PUBLIC_JWKS_URI
 environment variable.

Your API routes are located under the 
/api
 path.

Adapt it to your specific use case as needed.

You can now use the 
req.user
 object in your API routes to access the user's identity.

Example API Route
export default function handler(req, res) {
  // The JWT payload will be available as req.user if the token is valid
  if (req.user) {
    return res.status(200).json({ message: "Success", user: req.user });
  } else {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }
}
